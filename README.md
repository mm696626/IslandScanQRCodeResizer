# IslandScanQRCodeResizer

### Island Scan QR Code Resizer
* A tool to resize QR codes to be scanned for the Island Scan feature primarily for Citra (which unfortunately ceased development)
    
### Setup to get this tool working
* Have any PNG or JPG image of a QR code on your computer
* Open the tool (you'll need the latest JDK installed for that)
    * Link to JDK: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
* Press Select Image of QR Code and Resize and then the tool will ask for an image
* Once you have picked your image, your image will automatically be created
* Scan your QR code in game for Island Scan Points!

### Note
* This was designed for the Generation 7 Pokemon games (Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon).
* I don't know if it'll work for any other 3DS games
