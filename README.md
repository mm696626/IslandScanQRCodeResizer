# IslandScanQRCodeResizer

### Island Scan QR Code Resizer
* A tool to resize QR codes to be scanned for the Island Scan feature primarily for Citra (which unfortunately ceased development)
    
### Setup to get this tool working
* Have any PNG or JPG image of a QR code on your computer
* Open the tool (you'll need the latest JDK installed for that)
    * Link to JDK: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
* Press Select Image of QR Code and Resize and then the tool will ask for an image
    * You can also use a folder of images if desired to resize all images in the folder
* If you need to crop your QR Code, press Crop Image of QR Code and Resize instead and follow the prompts
* Once you have picked your image, your image will automatically be created
* Scan your QR code in game for Island Scan Points!

### Note
* This was designed for the Generation 7 Pokemon games (Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon).
* I've tested Pokemon ORAS and that works as well, so this might be a general QR code tool for Citra
